Insurance charges predictions

## Online Predictions:
Online prediction scenarios are for cases where you want to generate predictions on a one-by-one basis for each datapoint. For example, you could use predictions to make immediate decisions about whether a particular transaction is likely to be fraudulent.

## Batch Predictions:
Batch prediction is useful when you want to generate predictions for a set of observations all at once.

## Business Context:
An insurance company wants to improve its cash flow forecasting by better predicting patient charges using demographic and basic patient health risk metrics at the time of hospitalization

## Objective:
To build a web application that supports online (one-by-one) as well as batch prediction using trained machine learning model and pipeline.

## Tasks:
1. Train, validate and develop a machine learning pipeline using PyCaret.
2. Build a front-end web application with two functionalities: (i) online prediction and (ii) batch prediction.
